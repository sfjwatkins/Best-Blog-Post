# Best-blog-post
What are the best topics for a blog post aimed at university students?

This is research project I carried out for a client that provides marking services for university students. They run an blog and wanted some insight into what the best topics for their blog posts could be. 

Please note: the Framework and code is adapted a guided project on DataQuest's Data Science pathway- see Notebook for details.  

For the research, I accessed information from the Academic Stack Exchange, via the Stack Exchange Explorer; cleaned the data; then explore and visulised the most popular tags that were being used on this stack exchange.
